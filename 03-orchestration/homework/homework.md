## Question 1. Run Mage

First, let's run Mage with Docker Compose. Follow the quick start guideline. 

What's the version of Mage we run? 

(You can see it in the UI)

Answer:
```v0.9.70```

## Question 2. Creating a project

Now let's create a new project. We can call it "homework_03", for example.

How many lines are in the created `metadata.yaml` file? 

- 35
- 45
- 55 - correct
- 65

Answer:
```55 lines```

## Question 3. Creating a pipeline

Let's create an ingestion code block.

In this block, we will read the March 2023 Yellow taxi trips data.

How many records did we load? 

- 3,003,766
- 3,203,766
- 3,403,766 - correct
- 3,603,766

Answer:
```3403766```


## Question 4. Data preparation


Let's use the same logic for preparing the data we used previously. We will need to create a transformer code block and put this code there.

This is what we used (adjusted for yellow dataset):

```python
def read_dataframe(filename):
    df = pd.read_parquet(filename)

    df.tpep_dropoff_datetime = pd.to_datetime(df.tpep_dropoff_datetime)
    df.tpep_pickup_datetime = pd.to_datetime(df.tpep_pickup_datetime)

    df['duration'] = df.tpep_dropoff_datetime - df.tpep_pickup_datetime
    df.duration = df.duration.dt.total_seconds() / 60

    df = df[(df.duration >= 1) & (df.duration <= 60)]

    categorical = ['PULocationID', 'DOLocationID']
    df[categorical] = df[categorical].astype(str)
    
    return df
```

Let's adjust it and apply to the data we loaded in question 3. 

What's the size of the result? 


- 2,903,766
- 3,103,766
- 3,316,216 - correct
- 3,503,766


Answer:
```3316216```
